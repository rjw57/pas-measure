# Experiment in image measurement using the PAS website

This is a work in progress.

Install and compile via ``npm install && make``.

## Requirements

Annoyingly, some dependencies require Node.js version 0.12 or later. For Ubuntu
machines, these can be installed from the [nodesource
repository](https://nodesource.com/blog/nodejs-v012-iojs-and-the-nodesource-linux-repositories/).
